# TheTraveler
 
Solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) with 2 differents algorithm.

The first algorithm work with a brute force approach with a random starting city and give the best result each time.

The second algorithm work with a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach.

Change the differents main files to test the two algorithm.
