# TheTraveler
 
Solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) with 2 differents algorithm.

The first algorithm work with a brute force approach with a random starting city and give the best result each time.

The second algorithm work with a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach.

It explores the solution space by iteratively updating the population of potential solutions (represented by permutations of cities) to find the optimal solution.

Change the differents main files to test the two algorithm.
